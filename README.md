# SharePoint Client in C#

## Overview

This document provides information on how to integrate a C# application with SharePoint using the SharePoint Client Object Model. The SharePoint Client Object Model is a set of libraries provided by Microsoft that allows for remote interaction with SharePoint data from a client-side application.

## Prerequisites

- Microsoft SharePoint Server
- Visual Studio
- .NET Framework

## Setting Up the Environment

1. **Add SharePoint Client Libraries:**
   - Open your C# project in Visual Studio.
   - Add references to `Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.dll` and `Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.Runtime.dll`.
   - These libraries can be found in the SharePoint server or can be installed via NuGet package manager.

2. **Include Namespaces:**
   Add the following namespaces to your C# file:
   ```csharp
   using Microsoft.SharePoint.Client;
   ```

## Basic Code Example

The following is a basic example of how to connect to a SharePoint site and retrieve the title of the site:

```csharp
class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        string siteUrl = "https://yoursharepointsite.com";
        string userName = "yourusername";
        string password = "yourpassword";

        SecureString securePassword = new SecureString();
        foreach (char c in password)
        {
            securePassword.AppendChar(c);
        }

        ClientContext context = new ClientContext(siteUrl);
        context.Credentials = new SharePointOnlineCredentials(userName, securePassword);

        Site site = context.Site;
        context.Load(site);
        context.ExecuteQuery();

        Console.WriteLine("Site Title: " + site.Title);
    }
}
```
